Built a machine learning model using Decision Tree Classifier to predict the authenticity of
banknotes based on four features: variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy. Preprocessed
the data using Python and scikit-learn, and achieved an accuracy of 95%. The model was
integrated into a banknote authentication system for practical use.
